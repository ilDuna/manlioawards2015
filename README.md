# Manlio Awards 2015
[![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WTF-red.svg)]()
A simple slideshow with winners for each category, background music and subtitles.
To create (or remove) a slide just add a div with class ``slide`` and whatever id inside div ``#container-wall``.
Then use the json template to order your slides and add subtitles for each of them. Remember to refer the json from the main.js.
A preview is available [here](http://ilduna.github.io/manlioawards2015/).
Full experience (w/ music) is not available on tablets (iPad) for a security limitation which blocks javascript from automatically playing background music.

## Requirements
- Jquery
- Animo.js
